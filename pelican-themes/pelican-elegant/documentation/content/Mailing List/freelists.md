Elegant shows a form to subscribe to your newsletter, above the fold, in the right section of every article.

You need to put your FreeLists name in `FREELISTS_NAME` in your configuration file.

To customize user experience you can also define,

1. `EMAIL_SUBSCRIPTION_LABEL`,
1. `EMAIL_FIELD_PLACEHOLDER` and
1. `SUBSCRIBE_BUTTON_TITLE`

!!! Warning

    FreeLists has deprecated the form Elegant used. Due to which,
    user is redireced to FreeLists [deprecation notice page](https://www.freelists.org/cgi-bin/subscription.cgi).
    If your `FREELISTS_NAME` is correct then their notice page has a link to their new form.

    Fixing this issue is on our roadmap. You can track it [here](https://github.com/Pelican-Elegant/elegant/issues/412).
